Excercise 2: Record a video depicting a scenario including{

1. Tell about a project that u worked on, dress professionally.

I had this project that I had to work on, which was a method of transforming base pairs to codons.

The reason that I selecting this project to do was that it was 2 months into the project period, and I was combing the 
internet for ideas, I saw this interesting video on how to make animals in youtube, and i thought, well what If I wanted 
to make animals that do different things? 

That would require a way for the computer to interpret the materials that form the living animals, so I spent another 2 months 
wresltling with the compiler to get it to print the result that I desired. 

I was so frustrated, when after so many times, the compiler would run, but it would not print what I wanted. I 
consider this program to be 1 of my tiny moments of triumph, when I was able to show my teacher exactly how it was supposed 
to work, and I was able to complete two other related programs at the same time.
